       "'\\nProblem is about to classify the following customer reviews as either \"Platform-Specific\" or \"Service-Specific\" based on the context of the review. Additionally, extract keywords that correspond to the identified category. For each review, provide a label and a list of relevant keywords. \\nContext: Some online platforms like Urban Company,Angi etc have started online booking of services. These platforms connect professionals to customers and facilitate the scheduling of services. Platform-Specific reviews are related to app,customer call, pricing and booking  related, the User Interface (UI) is bad). Service-Specific reviews are related to quality of the service, professionalism or their behaviour.\\nHere are some INPUT-OUTPUT examples for your reference-\\nINPUT-\\nReview: App does not open when you need it to open and if it does it is so slow...horrible I have been trying to cancel my booking but it does not happen and the app starts working just when the partner is about to come and then you cannot cancel and is forced to take the service. Pathetic The more number of service you take higher are the taxes without explanation\\nOUTPUT-\\nKeywords: [App,booking, taxes]\\nLabel: Platform-Specific\\nINPUT-\\nReview: Their \\'professionals\\' are anything but professional. They are impunctual, indisciplined, not reachable, not accountable, not responsible. They switch off the tracking, dont answer the phone, u name it. Its better to get the services from the neighborhood vendors. Theres no way to upload the video here as to how their app and workers work in tandem to fool the customer. Hopeless service.\\nOUTPUT-\\nKeywords: [professionals,service]\\nLabel: Service-Specific\\nINPUT-\\nReview:I had used the app to install 3 AC\\'s in three different locations and each time I have had issues with technicians. They do not handle the inlet or any product carefully. They always have a irritating answer to our question. If we try complaining customer service you do not have good options to connect directly. Overall technicians aren\\'t trained so well and they lack technical skills. Today I booked a technician and he said that he doesn\\'t want to service and asked me to book again. Horrible\\nOUTPUT-\\nKeywords: [technicians, service]\\nLabel: Service-Specific\\nINPUT-\\nReview:I had a bad experience with Urban Company. I booked a service for my AC and the technician came after 3 hours. He was not well trained and did not know how to handle the product. He was not well dressed and was not professional.
