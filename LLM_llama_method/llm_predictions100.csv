Review: Previously there was an option of choosing a Spa expert or book the previous person you had taken service from, but that option is no longer available!!

Problem is about to classify the following customer reviews as either ""Platform-Specific"" or ""Service-Specific"" based on the context of the review. Additionally, extract keywords that correspond to the identified category. For each review, provide a label and a list of relevant keywords. 
Context: Some online platforms like Urban Company,Angi etc have started online booking of services. These platforms connect professionals to customers and facilitate the scheduling of services. Platform-Specific reviews are related to app,customer call, pricing and booking  related, the User Interface (UI) is bad). Service-Specific reviews are related to quality of the service, professionalism or their behaviour.
Here are some INPUT-OUTPUT examples for your reference-

Review: App does not open when you need it to open and if it does it is so slow...horrible I have been trying to cancel my booking but it does not happen and the app starts working just when the partner is about to come and then you cannot cancel and is forced to take the service. Pathetic The more number of service you take higher are the taxes without explanation

Review: Their 'professionals' are anything but professional. They are impunctual, indisciplined, not reachable, not accountable, not responsible. They switch off the tracking, dont answer the phone, u name it. Its better to get the services from the neighborhood vendors. Theres no way to upload the video here as to how their app and workers work in tandem to fool the customer. Hopeless service.
